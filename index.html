<h2>About Me</h2>

<p class="intro">I am a first year Economics student at Egerton University. </p>

<p class="reasons">I decided to study programming because technology is a very interesting concept in the society we live in.
  Personally I see programming as a challenge to learn more about the functioning and creation of the many devices created in the past and future.
  As time goes by most of the world will one day become one through technology and I would want to be a part of creating this. </p>

<p class="hobbies">My hobbies include swimming, reading novels, watching movies and playing table tennis.</p>
